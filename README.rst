Quickstart
==========

For the impatient: Below is a code example. If you can read and understand
this in less than 1 minute, you will be bored by all which comes next. It
would make sense to skip this and move on to other topics.

.. todo::

   include here a full code example (~ 100 LoC) which shows everything which is
   covered in the subsequent chapters.


Directory Structure
===================

The ``lessons`` dir contains all lessons, sorted chronologically, starting
with ``001``, followed by ``002`` and so on. One such lesson is **not**
necessarily bound to a time box. It **is** bound to one specific concept or
idea or learning. Each lessons contains these artifacts:

* ``slides`` contains all the *showing* aspect for face 2 face comm.
* ``exercises`` contains all code for doing what we talked about in the slides
* ``prose`` contains all reference texts with longer explanations, definitions,
  terms and suchlike



Communication Channels
======================

async first!

#. mailing list (ML)
#. code review
#. slack / irc / ???
#. video chat => ML

.. important::
   video chat is time boxed and the content previously communicated.
   It is the last mean of choice, if the others proofed to fail for this topic.
   The problem statement and outcome will be brought back to the ML by the
   student to be shared with the others (*fanout*).


Things you need to set up
=========================

* email account (plain text, no HTML, no signature)
* subscribe to the ML with email account
* bookmark the ML archive
* ``git`` locally installed
* github account
* subscribe to Gerrit with github account
* slack / irc / ?? acount
